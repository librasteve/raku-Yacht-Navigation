## Yachts and Navigation - Raku Coding Companion

This Jupyter Notebook is intended as a Raku coding companion to anyone who is working on the theory aspects of yachting. The original code is located ad maintained here https://github.com/p6steve/raku-Yachts-Navigation.

The aim is to help intermediate students of yacht cruising to learn and appreciate modern software coding techiques and to apply them to perform interactive calculations.

The author has chosen raku over other programming languages, such as Python or Go, for a number of reasons: (i) Unicode makes it more natural to express nautical formulae, (ii) Rational numbers are more suitable for navigation problems, (iii) it combines Object Oriented, Functional and Procedural programming in a expressive way that matches the needs of nautical problems and (iv) it has a basic set of commands 'baby raku' that can be grasped quickly by newcomers to programming.

No prior knowledge of yachting or coding are needed to start - the concepts are introduced gradually by example.

More on raku language can be found at http://raku.org and http://docs.raku.org. I highly recommend 'Think Raku' by Laurent Rosenfeld, with Allen Downey (https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-perl-6/) as an excellent introduction to modern programming for beginningers without any prior knowledge of coding. Raku is the new name for perl6.
